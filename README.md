This repository contains a _python_ library supporting the paper _Heard, N.A., Mantziou, A., Thiede, P.R.J. and Sanna Passino, F. "Topic modelling of command lines for attack pattern detection in cyber-security"_ ([preprint](https://arxiv.org)). 

* `notebooks` contains Jupyter notebooks with examples on how to use the library and reproduce the results in the paper,
* `lib` contains the _python_ library.

The _python_ library can be installed in edit mode as follows:
