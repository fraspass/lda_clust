# Unsupervised attack pattern detection in honeypot data using Bayesian topic modelling

This repository contains a _python_ library supporting the paper *Sanna Passino, F., Mantziou A., Ghani, D., Thiede, P., Bevington, R. and Heard, N. A. (2023) "Unsupervised attack pattern detection in honeypot data using Bayesian topic modelling"*, available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02505). 

The library `lda_clust` can be installed in edit mode as follows:
```
pip install -e lib/
```
The library can then be imported in any _python_ session:
```python3
import lda_clust
```

A demo on how to use the library can be found in `notebooks/test_library.ipynb`.
